# Project Overview

The Community Knowledge Sharing Platform will function as a user-friendly web application where users can post
solutions to problems, new ideas, or tips, while also enabling community interaction through comments, upvotes, and
categorization. This project will teach interns to build an interactive form, manage user-generated content, and create a
responsive and engaging front end.

# Core Features
# User Registration and Authentication
- Sign Up/Login:Allow users to register, login, and manage their profiles.
- Roles and Permissions: Basic roles like "User" and "Admin" to help moderate the platform.

# Post Creation and Management
- Create Post: Users can submit new posts through a form with fields like title, description, tags, and an option to attach links or code snippets.
- Post Categories: Enable users to categorize their posts under tags (e.g., "Bug Fixes," "Best Practices," "New Ideas").
- Edit/Delete: Users can edit or delete their own posts.

# User Interaction and Feedback
- Upvote/Downvote: Users can upvote or downvote posts, helping the most relevant or helpful posts rise to the top.
- Comments: Allow users to leave comments on posts for additional insights, questions, or discussions.
- Social Sharing: Provide options to share posts on social media platforms for greater reach.

# Search and Filter Options
- Search Bar: Let users search posts by keywords, title, tags, or author.
- Filters: Filter posts by categories, popularity (e.g., most upvoted), or date.

# Profile Management
- User Dashboard: A profile section where users can view their posts, comment history, and upvote statistics.
- Points or Reputation System: Award points for posting, receiving upvotes, or commenting, with reputation levels to encourage engagement.

# Notifications and Alerts
- Activity Notifications: Notify users when someone comments on or upvotes their post.
- Weekly Digest: Optional feature to send a weekly email summarizing popular posts or new ideas.

# Advanced Features (Optional)
- Markdown Support: Allow users to format their posts using Markdown for code snippets, lists, etc.
- Tags and Mentions: Implement hashtags and user mentions (e.g., @username) to enhance community engagement.
- Content Moderation: An admin panel for reviewing flagged content and managing user-generated posts to maintain quality.

# Tech Stack
- Back-end: ASP.NET Core (for .NET) or PHP Laravel (for PHP) for handling user authentication, post management, and data persistence.
- Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, with React or Vue.js to create interactive, component-based UI for posting and filtering.
- Database: SQL Server (for .NET) or MySQL/PostgreSQL (for PHP) to store posts, comments, user profiles, and interaction data.
- Version Control: Git and GitHub for source control and collaboration.

# Skills and Learning Outcomes
This project will help interns:
- Develop CRUD functionality and manage user interactions.
- Design an intuitive and interactive form for post submission.
- Implement RESTful APIs for post management and user interactions.
- Work with databases to handle user-generated content.
- Build a user-friendly front end with responsive design principles.

By working on this Community Knowledge Sharing Platform, interns will gain practical experience in full-stack
development, enhancing their understanding of user-centric design and collaborative coding practices.
